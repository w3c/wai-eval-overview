00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Web accessibility conformance evaluation.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.700
Conformance evaluation determines

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.300
how well your content
meets specific accessibility standards,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.480
such "W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"
or "WCAG" for short.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.220
Often you'll want to do conformance evaluation:

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.240
as a final check before releasing a product;

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.060
in order to provide information
to potential purchasers of your product;

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
to regularly monitor the accessibility
of your website;

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.100
before procuring a product;

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
and when getting started
with implementing accessibility,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.940
to get a list of accessibility issues
that you need to address.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.180
To do effective conformance evaluation,
you need expertise in:

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.160
accessibility standards;

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.960
accessible web design and development;

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.080
assistive technologies;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.320
and in how people with disabilities use the Web.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.390
You'll probably also want to use
evaluation tools to be more efficient.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.351
"WCAG-EM", the "Website Accessibility Conformance
Evaluation Methodology",

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.660
provides a structure
for your evaluation process.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.220
It describes a process to:

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.980
define the scope of your evaluation;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.700
explore your website assets;

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.880
select a representative sample
of web pages from your website;

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.100
evaluate the selected sample;

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.220
and report your evaluation findings.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.020
WCAG-EM also recommends involving real users
with disabilities during evaluation,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.630
to help you address the real-life experience
of your website users.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.760
The open source WCAG-EM Report Tool
helps you follow the methodology,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.570
record the outcomes,
and download a report of your evaluation.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.960
Web accessibility:
essential for some, useful for all.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:08.520

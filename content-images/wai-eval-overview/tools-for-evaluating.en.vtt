00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.340
Tools for evaluating web accessibility.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.880
There are software programs and online services
to help you identify accessibility barriers.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.380
They can save you lots of time and effort
on evauation,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.120
and can help you avoid creating
new accessibility barriers.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.740
However, tools can't do it all.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.580
Some accessibility checks cannot be automated
and require manual intervention.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.840
Some tools guide you through the checks
that cannot be automated.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.720
Some tools check one page at a time,
while others can scan entire websites.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.260
Tools can be integrated
into different work environments.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.060
For example, into your web browser,
content management system or CMS,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.700
and your development and deployment tools.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.560
They support different roles in a project team,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.680
such as content authors, code developers,
designers, and product owners.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.620
Note that in some cases tools can provide
inaccurate results.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.280
So avoid relying too much on what tools say

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.540
over addressing the real-life experience
of website users.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.240
"Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools"
explains what tools can and cannot do,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.200
and what to look for in tools that meet your needs.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.830
The list of web accessibility evaluation tools
has filters to help you find the right tool

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.280
for your particular situation.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.510
Equipped with tools and knowledge
on how to use them,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.780
you are in good shape to find
accessibility barriers more efficiently.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.300
Web accessibility:
essential for some, useful for all.

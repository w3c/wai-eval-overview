00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.160
Involving users in web accessibility.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.600
Accessibility is about making your websites

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.400
and applications usable
by people with disabilities.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.100
That includes your customers, clients,
employees, students, and others.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.140
Unfortunately many approach accessibility
just as a checklist.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.300
This risks missing
the real purpose of accessibility

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.480
the user experience.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
Involving people with disabilities
through your design and development process

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360
can be more effective and yield better results:

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.140
designers and developers
learn how people with disabilities use the web,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.160
and understand assistive technologies
and adaptive strategies they use;

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.540
the project team is more motivated

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.060
when they understand
how their work impacts people's lives;

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.380
development is more efficient,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.140
and your products work better for more people,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.360
with and without disability;

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.620
and your resulting products are more inclusive
and reach a bigger audience,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.540
have higher customer satisfaction,
and demonstrate social responsibility.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.690
"Involving Users in Web Projects for Better,
Easier Accessibility"

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.940
provides guidance on project planning,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.260
and throughout the design
and development process.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.040
"Involving Users
in Evaluating Web Accessibility"

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.200
provides more specific guidance
on the evaluation stage of the process.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.720
Together these resources help you focus
on accessibility for your website users

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.580
rather than focusing
on technical requirements only.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.080
Web accessibility:
essential for some, useful for all.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.860

Easy checks for web accessibility.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.663
Even if you are new to web accessibility
and not technical,

00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:12.660
you can check some aspects
of accessibility yourself.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.640
"Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility"

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.760
gives you step-by-step instructions

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.040
to get a rough idea
of the accessibility of any web page.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.380
For example, a web page from your own website,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.740
from your competitor,
or from suppliers you might want to work with.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.700
It's not a complete evaluation of accessibility.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.780
More assessment by professionals is needed
for a definitive and comprehensive evaluation.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.540
Sometimes doing just a few of these checks

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
can give you an indication
of the overall accessibility.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.570
Some checks are simple.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.620
For example, looking at the title of the web page
displayed in the browser window.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.300
You can do most of the checks
using any web browser.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.420
Some checks are easier
using an extension for your browser.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.480
